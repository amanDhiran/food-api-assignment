This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanDhiran/food-api-assignment.git
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Install dependency:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
Run the app:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

>⚠️Ideally you would use a .env file to store the API URL, I did not do it for the sake of simplicity.


## How I solved the problem
I used Next.js because of following reasons: 
- It makes it easier and more efficient to fetch data 
- Using shadcn for styling 
- Routing is easier

First of all i had to learn more about the Open Food Facts API, so most of my time went into exploring their website because the documentation they provided were not very good.

After I got the API endpoints I needed to fetch data in the application, I started coding the website. I kept UI simple yet intuitive and user-friendly.

There was no endpoint to sort the data the way we wanted so I did sorting in-house.
I used server actions to fetch data.

## Time taken to complete the assignment
It took me about an 40 mins to learn about the API (again because the documentation was not very good).

I got the application up and running with all the required features in about 3 hours, took me another 1 hour to refactor the code and make improvements.

So I spent about 4 hours coding and 40 minutes researching.
